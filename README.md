Hi. This is my attempt at coding Tetris in C++ within the terminal! As far as I can tell, this will only work on Linux distributions due to the use of ncurses. I did my best to go into this blind without looking up "How to code Tetris in C++" or any other things of that like. In order to get this working you need to install ncurses & SDL1.2 (SDL2 removed some functions that will make this program not work).

Then just navigate to the repo. Type make (I'm assuming you have the g++ and make downloaded, but if you don't you will have to do this)

./tetris.exe and it will start playing. Make sure that you are clicked into the box that spawns when you type because that is how the keypresses are being processed.
